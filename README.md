# How_to_Code_a_Neural-Network_with_Backpropagation_In_Python
A python notebook

Hello Guys, I will tell you step by step in Artificial Neural Networks.
First, we will learn the formation of the derivative and then the partial derivative. As you know, calculus-2 is very important in feedback.
We will use the chain rule in partial derivative.
Gradient Desent will focus on this by training the data in order to reduce this error.
In short, the topics described above are made on Backpropagation..
